        Thank you for those final clarifying details. I have updated Mr. Duley’s profile with his correct birthplace, his precise enlistment dates, and his specific rating of Senior Chief Gunner’s Mate (GMCS).

Being a Senior Chief Gunner’s Mate is particularly significant given his "water geyser" defense story—it confirms he was a senior expert in the very weapons systems (the 8-inch guns) he used to save the Vincennes.

                <h2>Horace Ray Duley (1919-2021)</h2>
                <p><strong>First President and Chairman of the Board</strong></p>
                <p>Born on March 22, 1919, in Mt. Vernon, Indiana, Mr. Duley grew up on a farm along the Ohio River. Watching the steamboats pass his childhood home sparked a lifelong love of the water that led him to a distinguished 23-year career in the U.S. Navy.</p>

            <h3>⚓ Senior Chief Gunner’s Mate (GMCS) | USN 1939–1962</h3>
            <p><strong>The "Writing on the Wall":</strong> In October 1939, as war erupted in Europe, Mr. Duley enlisted in the Navy. His service spanned the entirety of WWII, the Korean War, and the early Cold War, retiring in June 1962 at the senior enlisted rank of GMCS.</p>

            <p><strong>The Doolittle Raid & Midway:</strong> Serving aboard the heavy cruiser <strong>USS Vincennes (CA-44)</strong>, he witnessed the launch of the B-25 bombers for the Doolittle Raid and defended the fleet during the pivotal Battle of Midway.</p>

            <p><strong>The "Water Geyser" Defense:</strong> In August 1942, during the invasion of Guadalcanal, Mr. Duley utilized his expertise as a Gunner’s Mate to defend the *Vincennes* against over 30 Japanese warplanes. He and his crew used the 8-inch guns to fire into the ocean in front of low-flying planes, creating massive geysers that tore the aircraft apart as they plowed into the water.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Savo Island Survival:</strong> After surviving the sinking of the *Vincennes* on August 9, 1942, he continued his Pacific service aboard the <strong>USS Santa Fe (CL-60)</strong>. Following his Naval retirement, he served as a civilian at the <strong>Naval Weapons Station Yorktown</strong> until 1976.</p>
